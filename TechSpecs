Tech Specs

Ok so in order to make the room and the stairs it shouldn't be too hard
basically, you would make objects that are on and off screen and they
can only be seen as the character moves to the right or left

the character is a variable and as he moves, he stays in the center of the
screen and everything else moves around him. he is a variable and the spawning
rooms and walls are variables that translate left and right as you press a and d.

characters functions are
jump which translates him up and back down. only he moves on the jump
run left, run right which moves the walls and ninjas left and right
sprint left and sprint right that moves everything faster to the left
  and right
attack which swipes his sword
  anything within 10 pixels or whatever will take damage

ninjas coming at you will also be variables that are spawned an increasing
amount based on the spawn level using a loop. Ninjas have health variable

ninjas functions are:
hit which swipes a sword and if it hits it decreases health
    this only runs if it is close to the center characters
run forward which runs forward
run back it runs back
jump makes the dude jump u know
almost always runs forward but sometimes jumps and runs back
    set through a loop that is different based on the level

the health bar is a sprite that is above each ninja

ninjas movements are sometimes random but are mostly targeted towards the main
player. they will be looped to create movements and increasing jumps and speed
at higher levels. If ninjas run into obstacles they jump.

the room platforms are just lines that will be set as a constraint so
that the character cant go through it.

each level has programable obstacles that are up to the designer

the images are put in with sprites.

health bars can be lines with fill in bars that can decrease with the percent
of damage that it does. so the bar is just filled with a designated percent
that will go down if it takes damage. damage taken is just a function
